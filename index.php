  <p>Hello.  I'm Jeremy, and I make web apps.  I'm motivated by building awesome products and solving hard problems.  I pride myself on writing readable code that works as well tomorrow as it does today.  I believe strongly in the value of open source software and share as much code as I can.  I work at YouTube.  My most interesting recent pet projects include <a href="http://jeremyckahn.github.com/stylie/" target="_blank">Stylie</a> and <a href="http://rekapi.com/" target="_blank">Rekapi</a>.  I also offer <a href="/tutor">free online tutoring</a> in front-end development.</p>
