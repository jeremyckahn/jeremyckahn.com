  <p style="font-weight: bold;">I am not currently scheduling new sessions, as I have been overwhelmed with requests as of late.  Once I am finished with the current round of tutoring sessions, I will be available for new students.  Sorry about that, but keep an eye on this page for updates!</p>
  <del>
  <p>In an effort to help move the web forward and train the next generation of web developers, I am offering free tutoring sessions via <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html" target="_blank">Google Hangouts</a>.  These sessions will be recorded and shared publicly via YouTube so that everyone may watch and learn from them.  You can watch previous tutoring sessions <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ79_svgJXRf-PjGM2GUCCc158yOb5ku1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <h3>Who am I?</h3>
  <p>I'm Jeremy.  I'm a Web Developer at YouTube, have <a href="https://github.com/jeremyckahn/" target="_blank">written numerous JavaScript libraries</a>, and have given talks at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGZB7lq9-Mk" target="_blank">conferences</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVY1YMOhWn8" target="_blank">meetups</a>.</p>
  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <p>These sessions will be completely free-form.  There is no curriculum, simply bring your questions and code problems, and I will do my best to help you figure them out.  I can't guarantee that I will always know the answer, but I'm pretty good at solving problems.  At the very least, I will get you closer to a solution.  Examples of what I can help you with in a tutoring session:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bugs in your HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
    <li>Best practices for front-end web development</li>
    <li>Writing maintainable and readable code</li>
    <li>Structuring an application or website</li>
    <li>General Q&amp;A about web development</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Of course, I will do my best to work with you on whatever front-end challenges you have.  My goal is to help spread knowledge of how to build better websites and applications.</p>
  <h3>Interested?</h3>
  <p>If you would like a tutoring session, please <a href="mailto:jeremyckahn@gmail.com?subject=Hi!%20Please%20tutor%20me!">email me</a> with the subject "Hi!  Please tutor me!" and we will schedule a session.  I'd like to limit the sessions to about a half hour, but I am flexible and will not cut you off abruptly.  Repeat sessions are welcomed.  I am generally available on weekends.  I am based in San Francisco, which is in the PDT/UTC-7 timezone (you can use <a href="http://everytimezone.com/" target="_blank">everytimezone.com</a> to find your time difference).</p>
  <p>I look forward to helping you!</p>
